# LearningDocker
This is a docker learning path. Maybe I will set it to public in the future.
For this, I'll mainly use a Python Django app and a ReactJs app.

### Why Docker?
- Run apps anywhere
- Easy to Automate
- Version Safety/Environment Consistency - Makes sure the project is always running in the same Environment.

### When Docker?
- 

## Environment Setup

## Creating an Application Image

## Run the application Container

## Communication between Containers

## Docker Compose
